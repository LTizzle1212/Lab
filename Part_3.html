  Vue and Vanilla JavaScript are different because one is a framework work and the other is a language so they are very different. Vue.js is component 
  based where you can build while using multiple components wheres Javascript is a little trickier because you have to add additional code if you want to 
  resuse the code. What else is differnt from Vue and Javasript is Javascript is way more coding and event listeners where Vue.js updates the DOM.

My solution for part 2 of the studen club roster is different because of using v-if, v-for, and v-else for Vue.js and was able for this to populate on the 
2nd part of the Student List Vue. js lab as the first part we did not use this. I prefer the 2nd part and using Vue.js as I comprehended this lab more than the first one.
